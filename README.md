## Installation

### System dependencies

- Ubuntu 20.04
- ROS Noetic
- C++11 and above

### ROS dependencies
```shell
sudo apt install ros-noetic-rviz-imu-plugin ros-noetic-move-base ros-noetic-navfn tmux python3-catkin-tools zsh python3-wstool python3-rosdep ninja-build stow
```

### Python dependencies

```shell
python -m pip install Pillow markupsafe==1.1.1 ipdb
```

### Perception

Please install `conda` first.

```shell
conda create -n me5413 python=3.8
conda activate me5413
conda install pytorch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install -c conda-forge opencv rosdep rospkg easyocr decorator pexpect numpy defusedxml ipdb
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python3.8/dist-packages
```

### SLAM

> Note: You can choose to install the relied SLAM packages. No need to install all of them.

#### 1. Cartographer 
Please open a terminal in your workspace and execute the following commands to install Cartographer.

- Install Cartographer Dependencies

  ```shell
  sudo rosdep init
  rosdep update
  rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO} -y
  ```

- Install Abseil-cpp Library

  Cartographer requires the `abseil-cpp` library, which needs to be manually installed using the provided script. Run the `install_abseil.sh` script:

  ```shell
  ~/your_workspace/src/ME5413_Final_Project/third_party/cartographer/cartographer/scripts/install_abseil.sh
  ```

-  Build and Install

   Build Cartographer ROS and install it:

   ```shell
   catkin build
   ```

   After completing these steps, Cartographer ROS should be successfully installed on your system. You can activate it by running:

   ```shell
   roslaunch final_slam mapping_carto.launch # default Mapping configuration
   roslaunch final_slam mapping_carto_2d.launch # 2D Cartographer Mapping
   roslaunch final_slam mapping_carto_3d.launch # 3D Cartographer Mapping
   ```

   An example mapping by 2D Cartographer is shown as follows:

   </p>

#### 2. Fast-LIO

Fast-LIO relies on `Livox-SDK` and `livox_ros_driver`, please satisify prerequisites first before compile `Fast-LIO`.


For **Ubuntu 18.04 or higher**, with **ROS >= Melodic**, the **default** PCL and Eigen is enough for FAST-LIO to work normally.

-  **Livox-SDK**
   `Livox SDK` is the software development kit designed for all Livox products and required by Fast-LIO. To install and compile the SDK, 
   please follow:

   ```shell
   cd ~/your_workspace/src/ME5413_Final_Project/third_party/Livox-SDK
   cd build && cmake ..
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

- **livox_ros_driver**

  `livox_ros_driver` is a ROS package used to connect LiDAR products produced by Livox, and is necessary for Fast-LIO. This package can be compiled by running

  ```shell
  cd ~/your_workspace
  catkin build livox_ros_driver
  ```

-  **Build and run Fast-LIO**

   If all the prerequisites are satisfied, Fast-LIO can be easily complied by running

   ```shell
   cd ~/your_workspace
   catkin build fast_lio
   ```

   To utilize Fast-LIO for mapping, execute the following commands:

   ```shell
   source ~/your_workspace/devel/setup.bash
   roslaunch final_slam mapping_fast_lio.launch
   ```

   An point cloud example is shown as follows:

   <p align="center">
       <img src="final_slam/maps/fast_lio_point_cloud.png" alt="fast_lio_pcd" width="40%">
   </p>


-  **Point Cloud to Map**

   After mapping with Fast-LIO, we offer a ROS package called `pcd2pgm` to convert the `.pcd` files generated by Fast-Lio (located in '**/src/third_party/FAST_LIO/PCD**') into standard `.pgm` map files. To compile this package, please execute:


   ```shell
   cd ~/your_workspace
   catkin build pcd2pgm
   ```

   To generate the map, run the following command:

   ```shell
   source ~/your_workspace/devel/setup.bash
   roslaunch pcd2pgm pcd2pgm.launch
   ```

   After seeing '**data size =**' displayed in the terminal, open a new terminal in your map folder and execute:

   ```shell
   rosrun map_server map_saver
   ```

   Then you can obtain the `.pgm` map file. An example is shown as follows:

   <p align="center">
       <img src="final_slam/maps/fast_lio_map.png" alt="fast_lio_map" width="40%">
   </p>

####  3. Map Fusion

   To fully utilize the information from maps obtained by Cartographer and Fast-LIO respectively, we provide a simple Python script with image processing methods to fuse these two high-quality maps into one. To perform this fusion, execute:

   ```shell
   cd ~/your_workspace/src/final_slam/scripts
   chmod +x map_fusion.py
   python3 map_fusion
   ```

   You will obtain the fused map named 'fusion_map.pgm' in '**/final_slam/map**'. The result is shown as follows:

   <p align="center">
       <img src="final_slam/maps/fusion_map.png" alt="fusion_map" width="40%">
   </p>


### Build

> Note: the SLAM packages should be built before this step.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/me5413_final_ws/src
cd ~/me5413_final_ws/
git clone https://github.com/brian00715/ME5413_Final_Project src

catkin config -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

catkin build final_slam final_pnc final_percep final_fsm jackal* interactive_tools me5413_world graph_search
```


## Running

### One-click launch

```shell
rosrun final_fsm start.sh
```

### Step-by-step launch
